Real-Time Call Metrics: Monitor incoming and outgoing call volumes, average call duration, and agent availability in real-time.

Agent Performance: Analyze individual agent performance with metrics such as call resolution time, customer satisfaction ratings, and call handling efficiency.

Service Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance: Track adherence to SLAs by measuring response times and resolution times against predefined targets.
